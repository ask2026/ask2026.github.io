ASK 2026 features working-group discussions in the afternoons. We aim to form several small groups, each focused on a specific topic, to foster collaboration and produce tangible research progress.

## WG1 — Cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives

- WG1-1: Security analysis of block ciphers
- WG1-2: Security analysis of stream ciphers
- WG1-3: Security analysis of hash functions and permutations
- WG1-4: Security analysis of authenticated encryption and MACs
- WG1-5: Quantum cryptanalysis
- WG1-6: AI-assisted cryptanalysis

## WG2 — Design of cryptographic primitives

- WG2-1: Provable security of symmetric cryptography; design of modes
- WG2-2: Design of new block ciphers, stream ciphers, symmetric encryption
- WG2-3: Design of quantum-resistant large-state ciphers

## WG3 — Efficient and secure implementation of symmetric cryptography

- WG3-1: Efficient implementation in classical/quantum scenarios
- WG3-2: Side-channel attacks and countermeasures

> The final set of working groups, and their moderators, will be announced closer to the workshop.
