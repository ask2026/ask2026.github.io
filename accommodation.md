Singapore has a wide range of accommodation options across price points.

## Suggested area

If you are also attending **FSE/ToSC 2026**, staying near the **FSE conference venue (Parkroyal Hotel on Beach Road)** can be convenient for the week.

## Other options

- City-centre hotels with easy dining and transport options.
- Hotels in the west (closer to NTU), if you prefer shorter commutes for ASK 2026.

> We will add hotel suggestions and booking guidance once the FSE hotel block and/or negotiated rates (if any) are confirmed.
